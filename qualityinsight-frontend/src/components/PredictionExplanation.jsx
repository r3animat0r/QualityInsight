          The prediction for the revision with the ID 1027689158 suggests that
          this article gets the grading B with the probability of 38%. This
          indicates that the article meets following structural criterias:
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Suitable referenced</li>
            <li>Has a defined structure</li>
            <li>Pictures or diagrams are present</li>
            <li>An Infobox is present </li>
          </ul>
          ORES article quality model only predicts the quality based on
          structural features, so a good and neutral writing style doesnâ€™t
          factor into the prediction but should also be important.

              sources
            </li>
            <li>add more images, videos or audio if possible</li>
            <li>
              add some links with relevant websites with a short description
